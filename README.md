# Mixtape-me

A nostalgic web application that leverages Spotify's Web API to showcase your top tracks in a retro 90s mixtape format. Share your musical taste with friends in style!

## 📝 Overview

In today's modern era, music is readily available online; you can play whatever you want whenever you want it. But it wasn't the case back then in the 90's before platforms like Spotify were invented. Music enthusiasts had to go to a record store or a CD store, go through each aisle to find their favorite songs and artists.

Mixtape-me aims to recreate that experience of walking through the doors of a record store, looking at CD covers and store walls with colorful albums, memorabilia, and photos, transferring the same experience in a digital form and sharing your mixtape with your friends! Using Spotify's technology, it has never been easier to find out who you listen to the most all year round, last 6 months, or even this year.

## 🎵 Features

- Log in with your Spotify account
- Access your top 5 tracks displayed as a retro mixtape
