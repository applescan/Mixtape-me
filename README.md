### Executive Summary
In today’s modern era, music is readily available online, you can play whatever you want whenever you want it. But it wasn’t the case back then in the 90’s before platforms like Spotify is invented, music enthusiast must go to a record store or a CD store, go through each aisle to find they favourite songs and artist. There’s a sense of nostalgia with going to a store and flicking through rows of CD’s nostalgia and driven by post pandemic angst, retro entertainment options are coming back to trend. 

Mixtape-me aims to recreate that experience of walking through the doors of a record store looking at CD covers and store walls with colourful albums, memorabilia, and photos, transferring the same experience in a digital form and sharing your mixtape with your friends! Using Spotify’s technology, it has never been easier to find out who you listen to the most all year round, last 6 months or even this year.
