        and mixtape-me will sort your top tracks according to your listening history on your Spotify account. Share your
        mixtapes by saving the image!

      <h4>
        How are the top tracks determined?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Mixtape-me uses your listening history from your Spotify account. All the data is provided by Spotify.

      <h4>
        How to save my mixtape?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Click the download button on top of the mixtapes, wait for a little bit and the file should be downloaded to
        your
        device.
        Sometimes it takes multiple downloads for the image to load properly,
        so if your first image download doesn't turn out right, please redownload the image, or simply take a screenshot
